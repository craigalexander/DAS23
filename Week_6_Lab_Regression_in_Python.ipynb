We will then extend these models to allow for more than one explanatory variable using multiple linear regression (MLR).\n"

A statistical model is a mathematical statement describing the variability in a random variable  $y$, which includes any relationship with the explanatory variable  $x$. The inclusion of random (unpredictable) components  $\\epsilon$, makes the model statistical, rather than deterministic. A simple linear regression model involves, as the name suggests, fitting a linear regression line to the data. Hence, a simple linear regression model can be written as follows:\n",

Thus, the full probability model for $y_i$ given $x_i$ $(y_{i}|x_i)$ can be written as\n",

We will use the standard convention of choosing a 5% level of significnce, and then decide to include terms in the mdel if the p-value of the associated parameter estimate is less than 0.05 (i.e. reject the null hypothesis that the parameter is zero)."
